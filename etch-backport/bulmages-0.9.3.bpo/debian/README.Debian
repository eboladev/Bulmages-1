bulmages for Debian
-------------------

This package includes a mixed upstream svn snapshot with changes done at 20061210 and later ones to get it stable/releseable.

In order to execute bulmacont or bulmafact at the first time you will need to install de databases.
To install bulmacont database the root must execute /usr/sbin/bulmacont-server-install
To install bulmafact database the root must execute /usr/sbin/bulmafact-server-install


We use the files /etc/bulmacont-server.conf and /etc/bulmafact-server.conf like flags in order to detect previous instalations of the databases.  That files will not be deleted by apt-get. If you want to reinstall bulmacont and bulmafact, please remove /etc/bulma* and drop bulmacont bulmafact and bgplangcont databases.
